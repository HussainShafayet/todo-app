# Todo App

A Todo List Application built with React.js featuring a Kanban-style interface with three distinct columns: New, Ongoing, and Done. The app allows users to manage tasks through different stages of completion with added functionalities like context menus, date pickers, and form pre-filling.

## Features

- **Three Columns for Task Management:**
  - **New:** Column for newly created tasks.
  - **Ongoing:** Column for tasks currently being worked on.
  - **Done:** Column for completed tasks.
- **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks to the New column with a title and description.
- **Task Management:** Users can move tasks between columns using a right-click context menu (desktop) or long-press (mobile).
- **Due Date:** For Ongoing tasks, users can set a due date using a date picker. Alerts are shown if tasks are overdue.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Form Pre-filling:** Users can pre-fill the task creation form with the last task's values using a copy icon.
